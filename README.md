# Indicator-to-Predict-Renal-failure-using-Machine-Learning

This Project is based on to indicate Chronic kidney disease or to Predict the Kidney failure using Machine learning Algorithms.

Since this is a Classification based problem we use Supervised Classification Machine Learning Algorithms.

It is implemented with 6 Supervised Classification Machine Learning Algorithms : Logistic regression ,K-NN algorithm ,Support vector Machine ,Naive Bayes Classifier ,Decision tree, Random forest classifier.

This model gets multiple attributes like Blood Pressure , RBC count ,WBC count etc,., as the independent input variables and predicts the output for the categorical data(weather the person diagonised Renal failure or not).
